# Spring Caching

 - Spring’s cache abstraction comes in two forms:
  - Annotation-driven caching
􏰀  - XML-declared caching

 - You can enable annotation-driven caching by adding @EnableCaching to one of your configuration classes. If you’re configuring your application with XML, you can enable annotation-driven caching with the <cache:annotation-driven> element from Spring’s cache namespace.
